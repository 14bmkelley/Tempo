1) As a user with a google account, I want to sign into the calendar application
with my google account, so that I can access my already saved calendars and
events.
2) As a group member, I want to merge my saved calendars with the rest of the group
and their saved calendars, so that I can see the times where all of us have no
events planned.
3) As a user, I want to look at all of the time options for meeting with others, so
that I can choose which option is the best for me.
