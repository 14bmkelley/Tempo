1. As a user, I want to coordinate amongst several people’s schedules to discover a common meeting time, so that I can meet with them.
2. As a team leader, I want to monitor my team’s individual work schedules, so that I can check that they are productive.
3. As a secretary, I want to edit calendars with concurrent information, so that I may keep people’s schedules consistent.
