USER STORIES:
1. As a user, I want to add the events of my Google contacts to a calendar, so that all of our calendar events can be organized on one calendar.
2. As a user, I want to make the application to add an event to my Google calendar, so that I do not have to manually add the event through the Google interface.
3. As a user, I want to vote on a common meeting time with my group members, so that all my group membersâ€™ time constraints are taken to into account.
